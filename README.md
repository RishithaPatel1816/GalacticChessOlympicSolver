# GalacticChessOlympicSolver
This project implements Quantum Chess board operations, including row-wise sorting, inversion counting, and closest pair detection in a 2D plane. It uses efficient divide-and-conquer algorithms for optimal performance. Commands allow matrix creation, sorting, inversion calculation, display, and closest pair identification.
